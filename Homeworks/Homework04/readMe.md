1. Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (We recommend to model them on your own as well)
2. Design the [Scotch Yoke Mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhX-8RyP214&ab_channel=SkylineTutorials) taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
3. Choose ONE mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion:

Requirements for 2 and 3:

  * Divide the mechanism into components
  * Use Fusion Rule Number 1
  * Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (Create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate)
  * Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project
  * Add appearances
  * Add joints
  * Create a motion study
  * Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well)

  OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on). You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.

  **BONUS**:  Make a video rendering with the mechanism displaying the motion study. Use the result to make a video tutorial where you present how the mechanism is working.
