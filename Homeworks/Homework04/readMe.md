1. Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (We recommend to model them on your own as well)
2. Design the Scotch [Yoke Mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhX-8RyP214&ab_channel=SkylineTutorials) taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
3. Choose ONE mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion:

Requirements for 2 and 3:

  1. Divide the mechanism into components
  2. Use Fusion Rule Number 1
  3. Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (Create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate)
  4. Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project
  5. Add appearances
  6. Add joints
  7. Create a motion study
  8. Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well)

  OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on). You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.

  BONUS:  Make a video rendering with the mechanism displaying the motion study. Use the result to make a video tutorial where you present how the mechanism is working.
